# Urban-Audio-Classification
This is an ML model of the urban audio classification.
The data-set is available on https://www.kaggle.com/pavansanagapati/urban-sound-classification
I have first converted all wav audios into MFC spectograms. Later used a CNN to classify into classes. 
Transfer learning was used to reduce train time.
